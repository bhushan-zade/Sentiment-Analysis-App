# **`Loan Eligibility Prediction`** 

This machine learning demo application predicts loan eligibility based on factors like income, credit history, employment type, marital status, gender, dependents, co-applicant income, loan amount, and residential area. The model uses classification algorithm such- Random Forest to make predictions. A user-friendly interface allows applicants to input their details for instant predictions, while model performance is evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. This project demonstrates the application of data-driven decision-making in the financial sector.
